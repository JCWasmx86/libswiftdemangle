/// Incrementally compute and represent basic block liveness of a single live
/// range. The live range is defined by points in the CFG, independent of any
/// particular SSA value. The client initializes liveness with a set of
/// definition blocks, typically a single block. The client then incrementally
/// updates liveness by providing a set of "interesting" uses one at a time.
///
/// This supports discovery of pruned liveness during control flow traversal. It
/// is not tied to a single SSA value and allows the client to select
/// interesting uses while ignoring other uses.
///
/// The PrunedLiveBlocks result maps each block to its current liveness state:
/// Dead, LiveWithin, LiveOut.
///
/// A LiveWithin block has a liveness boundary within the block. The client can
/// determine the boundary's instruction position by searching for the last use.
///
/// LiveOut indicates that liveness extends into a successor edges, therefore,
/// no uses within that block can be on the liveness boundary, unless that use
/// occurs before a def in the same block.
///
/// All blocks are initially assumed Dead. Initializing a definition block marks
/// that block LiveWithin. Each time an interesting use is discovered, blocks
/// liveness may undergo one of these transitions:
///
/// - Dead -> LiveWithin
/// - Dead -> LiveOut
/// - LiveWithin -> LiveOut
///
/// Example 1. Local liveness.
///
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
/// | Use |
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Example 2. Cross-block liveness.
///
/// Initial State after initializing a def block:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Use | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Later state after updateForUse is applied to the use:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveOut]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [LiveOut]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Use | [LiveWithin]
///  -----

///
/// "Use points" are the instructions that "generate" liveness for a given
/// operand.
///
/// ** Lifetime-ending uses **
///
/// When PrunedLiveness records uses, it caches the "lifetime-ending"
/// state. This flag has _zero effect_ on liveness. It refers to the use's
/// ownership constraint. But liveness does not map cleanly to ownership
/// lifetime. For extended live ranges, lifetime ending uses may occur in the
/// middle of liveness (a live-out block may contain a "lifetime-ending"
/// use). For incomplete ownership lifetimes, and for guaranteed phis,
/// non-lifetime ending uses may end liveness. This deliberate abstraction
/// leakage is only done for efficiency. Note that use-points are recorded as
/// instructions, not operands. Caching "lifetime-ending" state avoids the need
/// to visit all operands when computing liveness and, in the common case,
/// avoids the need for a separate operand map in the client.
///
/// ** Scoped operations **
///
/// Handling uses that must be live over a scope requires treating all the
/// scope-ending points as "use points". See
/// PrunedLiveRange<LivenessWithDefs>::recursivelyUpdateForDef for an example of
/// handling scopes.
///
/// ** Phis **
///
/// PrunedLiveness has no way to know whether a phi is intended to end a live
/// range. It consistently models all phi operands as uses in the predecessor
/// block (the branch is the use point). A guaranteed phi may or may not
/// actually end liveness depending on whether its enclosing def is an outer
/// adjacent phi. Liveness cannot, therefore, distinguish between a guaranteed
/// phi that ends liveness, and a dead guaranteed phi that does not end
/// liveness. In the later case, predecessor blocks are confusingly marked
/// live-within instead of live-out. visitInsertionPoints compensates by moving
/// the insertion point to the successor block.
